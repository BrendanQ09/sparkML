# 🚀 Spark ML - Machine Learning with Databricks & PySpark

SparkML is a machine learning project built with **Apache Spark MLlib** on **Databricks**, designed to process and train models on large-scale datasets efficiently.

## 📖 Project Overview
This project leverages **Apache Spark MLlib** for:
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Training models using Spark ML pipelines
- Evaluating model performance on distributed datasets
- Running Spark ML models on **Databricks**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Apache Spark** – Distributed data processing
- **PySpark** – Python API for Spark
- **Databricks** – Cloud-based Spark platform
- **MLlib** – Machine learning library for Spark
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For interactive development

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate # On macOS/Linux venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows


### 2️⃣ Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)
pip install -r requirements.txt


## 🚀 Running the Project
1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
jupyter notebook

2. Navigate to `sparkML.ipynb` and run the cells step by step.
3. If using **Databricks**, upload the notebook and execute it within a cluster.

## 📊 Machine Learning Workflow
✔ **Data Ingestion** – Loading large datasets into Spark DataFrames  
✔ **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values & feature transformations  
✔ **Feature Engineering** – Scaling, encoding, and vectorization  
✔ **Model Training** – Using Spark ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)  
✔ **Model Evaluation** – Metrics like accuracy, RMSE, and precision-recall  

## 📌 Next Steps
🔹 Enhance the ML pipeline with **hyperparameter tuning**  
🔹 Implement **deep learning models** using **Spark TensorFlow**  
🔹 Deploy models with **MLflow**
